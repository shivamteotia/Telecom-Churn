Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can analyze historical data to understand patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn.

Features
Data Analysis: Explore and analyze historical customer data.
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data for machine learning.
Model Development: Train and evaluate machine learning models for customer churn prediction.
Visualization: Visualize key metrics and insights related to customer churn.
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebooks
Required Python packages (list them)
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shivamteotia/Telecom-Churn.git

Usage
Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks directory.

Follow the steps outlined in each notebook for data analysis, preprocessing, and model development.

Experiment with different models and parameters to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation
We evaluate our models based on standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results and insights can be found in the results directory.
